Enable your AI assistant to seamlessly schedule meetings and appointments using Cal.com integration. This powerful feature allows your AI to check availability and book meetings directly during calls.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Cal.com integration, you'll need:

- A Cal.com account (either hosted or self-hosted)
- An event type configured in Cal.com
- An API key from Cal.com

## Setup Process

### 1. Cal.com Configuration

1. Sign up or log in to your [Cal.com](https://cal.com/) account
2. Create a new event type specifically for AI assistant bookings
   - Give it a clear name like "Meeting with AI Assistant"
   - Configure duration, availability, and other settings
3. Once created, note down the event ID from the URL

4. Generate an API key:
   - Go to Cal.com settings
   - Navigate to Developer Settings
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy and securely store the API key

### 2. Adding Cal.com to Your Assistant

1. In your AI assistant settings, locate the Tools section
2. Add the Cal.com integration
3. Configure the tool with:
   - Your Cal.com API key
   - The event type ID
     <img height="200" src="/resources/cal-tool.png" />

## Best Practices

- Create dedicated event types for AI bookings to track their usage
- Set clear buffer times between meetings
- Configure appropriate meeting durations
- Use descriptive event names that make sense to your customers

## Testing

After setup, we recommend:

1. Making a test call to your AI assistant
2. Requesting to schedule a meeting
3. Verifying the booking appears in your Cal.com dashboard
4. Checking the confirmation emails are received

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Verify your API key is active and has the correct permissions
- Ensure the event type ID is correct
- Check that your Cal.com availability is properly configured
- Confirm your timezone settings are correct
